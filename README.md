## Overview

This repo houses experimental bots that trade cryptocurrency tokens via decentralized exchanges.
Algorand is the only chain currently supported but Polygon and Arbitrum One are the next chains I intend to implement
bots for.

These bots are an on-going development effort and are really meant to showcase my blockchain development skills and
also serve as learning material for anyone interested in coding a project like this.
