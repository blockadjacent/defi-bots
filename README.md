# Multi-chain DeFi Bots

> Experimental multi-chain DeFi bots for automating a variety of tasks on cryptocurrency tokens.

## Overview

This repo houses experimental multi-chain bots that implement a variety of automated functions on a wallet's cryptocurrency tokens. Algorand is the only chain currently supported but Polygon and Arbitrum are the next chains on the roadmap to be supported. The range of functions performed include:

- Fulfilling limit order trades between pairs of supported Algorand tokens, via the Tinyman and Pact SDKs.

These bots are an on-going development effort and are being used internally by BlockAdjacent as part of the company's overall financial and investment growth strategies.
