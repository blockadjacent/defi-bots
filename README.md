## Overview

This repo houses experimental bots that trade cryptocurrency tokens via decentralized exchanges on different blockchains.
Algorand is the only chain currently supported but Polygon and Arbitrum One are the next chains on the roadmap to be supported.

These bots are an on-going development effort and are already being used extensively and successfully by our own team members.
